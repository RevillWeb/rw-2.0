Many of the projects that I worked on at East Midlands IT were bespoke web applications designed from scratch by myself, utilizing other developers where needed. The vast majority of these projects were developed using PHP on top of a MySQL database while using other modern frameworks such as jQuery.

        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <div class="section">
            <p>From the very first time I got my hands on the internet I wanted to create things for the web. My professional web development career got started when founding a small IT company while studying Computer Networks at University. The demand for websites and web applications was obvious and my previous freelance experience allowed me to take on all kinds of interesting projects. I then moved on to <strong>specialize in CRM systems development</strong> where I honed my <strong>PHP and mySQL skills</strong>. To accompany these specialized business platforms I looked to improving my <strong>front-end knowledge</strong> and came to love JavaScript. At the beginning of 2014 I had my first <strong>jQuery book published</strong> which was a great personal achievement. My real passion is for AngularJS which I spend most of my time working with these days. I use my blog <a href="http://www.revillweb.com/" target="_blank">www.revillweb.com</a> to publish articles and tutorials on web development in hope to help other enthusiastic web developers get started in new, upcoming technologies.</p>
            <div class="page-break"></div>
            <h3>Outside of Tech...</h3>
            <p>My main driver in life and my reasoning for becoming successful is so I am able to travel and see the world and do fun things with the people I care about. My hobbies outside of tech are fishing, pool and snooker of which I would love to do more of. I thoroughly enjoy meeting new people whether that's through work or travel (both would be best!). I have family in Germany so I've been able to travel to a fair few places in europe and recently spent a few weeks in Aruba (Caribbean) which has got me hooked on long distance vacationing, im hoping America is next.</p>
            <p>Personally I am a well-rounded individual who enjoys a challenge. I am confident in anything I do and believe that your work should be something you enjoy and are very passionate about.</p>
